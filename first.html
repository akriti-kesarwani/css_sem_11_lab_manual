<!-- Design a web page using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
which includes the following:
1) Use different font, styles:
In the style definition you define how each selector should work
(font, color etc.). Then, in the body of your pages, you refer to
these selectors to activate the styles. -->

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology in web development, providing a powerful means to control the visual presentation of HTML elements on a webpage. By defining rules that dictate how elements should appear, such as their colors, sizes, positions, and animations, CSS enables web designers and developers to create visually appealing and responsive websites. Its cascading nature allows for the inheritance of styles, facilitating efficient and consistent styling across multiple pages within a website. Moreover, CSS offers a wide range of selectors and properties, empowering developers to target specific elements precisely and customize their appearance to suit the design requirements. With the evolution of CSS frameworks and preprocessors, such as Bootstrap and Sass, CSS has become even more robust and versatile, enabling the creation of complex layouts and designs with ease while promoting maintainability and scalability in web projects.
